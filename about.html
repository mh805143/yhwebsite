      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student passionate about creating tech that empowers people —
        especially in education and accessibility. I love building tools that are playful, intuitive,
        and actually help solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        From designing the parent interface in Task Adventure to debugging SwiftUI views late at night,
        I’ve found joy in both logic and creativity. I believe tech should make life easier, not harder.

      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a senior Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton. What drives me is building programs that can benefit people and solve real problems. I want my work to make a difference, even if it only changes one person's life for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about coding and also love spending time outdoors. Hiking, fishing, exploring new places, and just taking in life are a big part of who I am. That balance helps keep me grounded and inspired.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to think of myself as someone who is very determined to solve problems in the most efficient and logical way possible. I enjoy pushing myself to find solutions that are clear, concise, and effective. I'm also an understanding person, a team player, goal-oriented, and someone who likes to bring humor to the process whenever I can.
      </p>

      <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
      <p>
        I helped lead a student team that built a working prototype of Task Adventure — and we won Best in Computer Science at
        the CSUF ECS Innovation Expo!
