      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a senior Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton. What drives me is building programs that can benefit people and solve real problems. I want my work to make a difference, even if it only changes one person's life for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about coding and also love spending time outdoors. Hiking, fishing, exploring new places, and just taking in life are a big part of who I am. That balance helps keep me grounded and inspired.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to think of myself as someone who is very determined to solve problems in the most efficient and logical way possible. I enjoy pushing myself to find solutions that are clear, concise, and effective. I'm also an understanding person, a team player, goal-oriented, and someone who likes to bring humor to the process whenever I can.
      </p>
